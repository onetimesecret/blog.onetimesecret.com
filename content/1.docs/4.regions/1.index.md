# Data Center Regions

Onetime Secret offers two data center regions: European Union (EU) and United States (US). This guide will help you understand the importance of region selection and how to choose the right one for your needs.

## Why Region Selection Matters

Choosing the right data center region is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Different regions have different data protection laws and regulations.
2. **Latency**: Choosing a region closer to your primary user base can reduce latency.
3. **Compliance**: Some organizations have specific requirements about where their data can be stored.

## Available Regions

### European Union (EU)

- **Location**: Within the European Union
- **Key Features**:
  - Compliant with GDPR and other EU data protection regulations
  - Ideal for European users or those serving primarily European customers

### United States (US)

- **Location**: Within the United States
- **Key Features**:
  - Compliant with US data protection laws
  - Suitable for US-based users or those primarily serving US customers

## How to Choose Your Region

Consider the following factors when selecting your data center region:

1. **For Individuals**:
   - Personal preference
   - Proximity to your location for potentially faster access
   - Personal data sovereignty concerns

2. **For Businesses**:
   - Legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR for EU customers)
   - Location of your primary customer base
   - Industry-specific compliance needs

3. **Technical Considerations**:
   - Latency requirements for your application
   - Integration with other services or systems
