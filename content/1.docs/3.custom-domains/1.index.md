# Custom Domains

## What are Custom Domains?

Custom Domains are an advanced feature that allows you to use your own domain name for Onetime Secret links, instead of the default onetimesecret.com domain. This feature adds a layer of branding and professionalism to your secret sharing activities, making it ideal for businesses and power users.

## Key Benefits

1. **Enhanced Branding**: Reinforce your company's identity by using your own domain for secret links.
2. **Increased Trust**: Recipients see a familiar domain, boosting their confidence in the shared information.
3. **Seamless Integration**: Create a cohesive experience that aligns with your existing digital presence.
4. **Professional Appearance**: Demonstrate a higher level of sophistication and commitment to security.
5. **Potential Analytics**: Leverage your domain's analytics tools for insights into usage patterns.

## Use Cases

Custom Domains are particularly valuable for:

- **Businesses**: Share sensitive information with clients using branded links.
- **Financial Institutions**: Securely communicate account details or transaction information.
- **Legal Firms**: Transmit confidential case information to clients or partners.
- **Healthcare Providers**: Share private patient information securely.
- **IT Departments**: Distribute login credentials or system access information.
- **HR Teams**: Communicate sensitive employee data or onboarding information.
- **Marketing Agencies**: Share campaign strategies or client-specific data securely.

## How Custom Domains Work

1. You register a domain or use one you already own.
2. Configure your domain's DNS settings to point to Onetime Secret's servers.
3. Set up the custom domain in your Onetime Secret account settings.
4. Once verified, your secret links will use your custom domain.

## Getting Started

To set up a Custom Domain:

1. Log in to your Onetime Secret account.
2. Navigate to Account Settings > Custom Domains.
3. Enter the domain you wish to use and click "Add Domain".
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided for DNS configuration.
5. Wait for the domain to be verified. If available, click the "Verify" button to expedite the process. You may need to refresh the page.

## Important Considerations

- Custom Domains are a premium feature available with the Identity plan.
- You are responsible for maintaining and renewing your domain registration.
- Proper SSL/TLS configuration is crucial for security (handled automatically by Onetime Secret).
- Ensure your chosen domain complies with your organization's branding guidelines.

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

- **DNS Propagation**: Changes may take up to 48 hours to fully propagate. Be patient and try again later if verification fails initially.
- **Incorrect DNS Records**: Double-check your DNS settings against the provided instructions.
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: Contact our support team if you encounter any SSL-related problems.
- **Domain Ownership Verification**: Ensure you have full control over the domain you're trying to set up.
