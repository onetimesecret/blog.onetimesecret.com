title: Setup Guide
description: This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a custom domain for your Onetime Secret account.
---


## Prerequisites

- An active Onetime Secret account with custom domain feature enabled
- A domain you own and can manage DNS settings for

## Step 1: Access Custom Domain Settings

1. Log in to your Onetime Secret account
2. Navigate to Account Settings > Custom Domains

## Step 2: Enter Your Domain

1. In the custom domain settings, enter your desired subdomain (e.g., secrets.yourdomain.com)
2. Click "Add Domain" or equivalent button to proceed

## Step 3: Configure DNS Settings

To connect your domain, you need to update your DNS settings:

1. Access your domain's DNS management panel (through your domain registrar or DNS provider)
2. Create or modify an A record with the following details:
   - Host: Your chosen subdomain (e.g., secrets)
   - Points to / Value: 109.105.217.207
3. Remove any existing A, AAAA, or CNAME records for the same subdomain

Important: Ensure there are no conflicting records for the subdomain you're using.

## Step 4: Verify Domain and Wait for SSL

1. After updating DNS settings, return to the Onetime Secret custom domain page
2. The system will automatically attempt to verify your domain
3. SSL certificate generation will begin once verification is successful
4. This process may take a few minutes to complete

## Step 5: Confirm Setup

Once setup is complete, you should see the following information:

- Domain Status: Active with SSL
- Target Address: identity.onetimesecret.com
- A Record: 109.105.217.207
- SSL Status: Active
- SSL Renewal Date: (Will be displayed, typically about a year from setup)

## Troubleshooting

- If verification fails, double-check your DNS settings
- Ensure you've removed any conflicting records
- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, though it's usually much faster

## Using Your Custom Domain

Once active, your secret links will use your custom domain. For example:
https://secrets.yourdomain.com/yoursecrethash

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Onetime Secret regularly monitors your domain's status
- SSL certificates are automatically renewed
- Check the "Last Monitored" timestamp to ensure ongoing connectivity

For any issues or questions, please contact Onetime Secret support.
