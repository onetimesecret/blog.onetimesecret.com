## What are Custom Domains?

Custom Domains enable you to use your own domain name for Onetime Secret links, instead of the default onetimesecret.com domain. This feature adds a layer of branding and professionalism to your secret sharing activities.

## How Custom Domains Work

1. You register a domain (or use one you already own).
2. You configure your domain's DNS settings to point to Onetime Secret's servers.
3. You set up the custom domain in your Onetime Secret account settings.
4. Once verified, your secret links will use your custom domain.

## Key Benefits

- **Branding**: Use your company or personal domain for a professional touch.
- **Trust**: Recipients see a familiar domain, increasing their confidence.
- **Customization**: Tailor the user experience to match your brand.
- **Analytics**: Potentially track usage through your domain's analytics tools.

## Use Cases

Custom Domains are ideal for:

- Businesses sharing sensitive information with clients
- Organizations wanting a cohesive branding experience
- Individuals looking to personalize their secret sharing

## Getting Started

To set up a Custom Domain:

1. Log in to your Onetime Secret account.
2. Navigate to Account Settings > Custom Domains.
3. Enter the domain you wish to use and hit Add Domain
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided for DNS configuration.
5. Wait for the domain to be verified. If available, click the Verify button to expedite the process. You may need to refresh the page.
