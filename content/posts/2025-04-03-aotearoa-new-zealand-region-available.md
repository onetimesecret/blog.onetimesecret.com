# Aotearoa New Zealand Region Now Available

Our data center network has expanded with an Aotearoa New Zealand location. The Aotearoa New Zealand region ([nz.onetimesecret.com](https://nz.onetimesecret.com)) maintains our share-nothing architecture - ensuring data created in Aotearoa New Zealand stays in Aotearoa New Zealand.

## Serving the South Pacific

The Aotearoa New Zealand instance complements our existing EU, US, and Canada sites. This expansion enhances data privacy options for users in Oceania and Asia-Pacific regions.

## Architecture and Privacy

Our share-nothing architecture ensures:
- Data created in Aotearoa New Zealand stays in Aotearoa New Zealand
- Each region maintains separate database, mail server, and storage systems
- No cross-region data sharing or synchronization

This deployment responds to organizations with specific data residency requirements in Oceania and the Asia-Pacific region. Aotearoa New Zealand's robust privacy laws provide strong data protection while improving performance for regional users.

## How to Use

Visit nz.onetimesecret.com directly or select "Aotearoa New Zealand" from the region selector. All security features available in other regions are fully implemented in the Aotearoa New Zealand instance.
