# Privacy by Design: Why we don't have a cookie notice

## A Different Approach
You might have noticed something missing on Onetime Secret: there's no cookie consent banner. That's not an oversight—it's by design. While most websites greet you with pop-ups about tracking and cookies, we've taken a deliberately different approach: we don't track you at all.

## Just the Essentials
Our service uses only the bare minimum cookies needed for core functionality:
- Session management
- Language and color mode preferences
- Data center selection (currently EU and US jurisdictions)

That's it. No tracking cookies, no third-party analytics, no behavior monitoring.

## Real Benefits of Not Tracking
This minimal approach delivers tangible benefits:
- Smaller attack surface for enhanced security
- Straightforward privacy policy without surprises
- Faster page loads without tracking
- scripts and bloated requests
- No cross-site tracking concerns

## Proven Since 2012
As a service that's been operating since 2012, we've proven that respecting privacy and delivering value go hand in hand. While others rely on tracking for improvements, we focus on what matters: direct user feedback and essential operational metrics. This keeps us aligned with our core mission of providing a reliable, trustworthy service for sharing sensitive information.

## How We Improve Without Tracking
Some ask how we improve our service without detailed analytics. Our approach is simple:
1. Direct user feedback through via email and our [feedback page](https://onetimesecret.com/feedback)
2. Open-source [community contributions](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret/issues) and insights
3. Focus on core functionality and security

## Open Source for Transparency
Our commitment to privacy extends to transparency about our practices. Our entire codebase is open source, allowing anyone to verify our privacy claims. We believe this level of transparency is essential for building and maintaining trust.

## Privacy in Practice
This isn't just about avoiding cookie notices—it's about providing a service that can earn your trust. When you share sensitive information through Onetime Secret, you can be confident that we're protecting not just your secrets, but your privacy at every level.

## Learn More
Our [open-source repository](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret) shows exactly how we implement these privacy principles in practice. We believe the best way to prove our commitment to privacy is to show our work.

> When generating new code:
>
> 1. Always produce a single code block.
> 2. Never separate the code into multiple code blocks.
> 3. Only include the code that is being added.
> 4. Replace existing code with a "lazy" comment like this: "// ... existing code ..."
> 5. The "lazy" comment must always be a valid comment in the current context (e.g. "<!-- ... existing code ... -->" for HTML, "// ... existing code ..." for JavaScript, "{/* ... existing code */}" for TSX, etc.)
> 6. You must always provide 1-2 lines of context above and below a "lazy" comment
> 7. If the user submits a code block that contains a filename in the language specifier, always include the filename in any code block you generate based on that file. The filename should be on the same line as the language specifier in your code block.
>
> Example 1:
> Input:
> ```test.js
> import addition from "addition"
>
> class Calculator {
>   constructor() {
>     this.result = 0;
>   }
>
>   add(number) {
>     this.result += number;
>     return this;
>   }
> }
> ```
> User request: Add a subtract method
>
> Output:
> ```javascript test.js
> // ... existing code ...
> import subtraction from "subtraction"
>
> class Calculator {
>   // ... existing code ...
>
>   subtract(number) {
>     this.result -= number;
>     return this;
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Example 2:
> Input:
> ```javascript test.js (6-9)
> function helloWorld() {}
> ```
>
> Output:
> ```javascript test.js
> function helloWorld() {
>   // New code here
> }
> ```
>
> Always follow these guidelines when generating code responses.
