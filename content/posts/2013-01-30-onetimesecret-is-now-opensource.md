We launched Onetime Secret on [November 8th, 2011](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3207489). Today we're happy to announce the first open source release of the Onetime Secret codebase under the MIT License. This is something we wanted to do from the very beginning but life and other work got in the way. It's important that we do everything we can to earn and maintain your trust and this is a crucial step in that direction. Also, *it's just the right thing to do.*

We're expecting (and hoping) this will help us discover (and resolve) more bugs. If you find a bug, [open an issue](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret/issues). If you have a feature request, you can open an issue for that too.

If you find a security-related bug, [let us know](https://onetimesecret.com/info/security) as soon as you can. We will disclose all serious issues here on this blog.

## Business subscription plans are deprecated

We're also announcing the deprecation of our Basic, Professional, and Agency subscription plans. Customers using these plans will be able to continue to use them. (Note: we are still available for [custom installs](mailto:custom@onetimesecret.com)).

## What's next

We have a bunch of new stuff planned for this year including some oft-requested new features and a mobile app. [Drop me a line](mailto:contribute@onetimesecret.com) if you're interested to help and want to know more.

### What is a Onetime Secret?

A one-time secret is a link that can be viewed only one time. A single-use URL.

### Why would I want to use it?

When you send people sensitive info like passwords and private links via email or chat, there are copies of that information stored in many places. If you use a one-time link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.
