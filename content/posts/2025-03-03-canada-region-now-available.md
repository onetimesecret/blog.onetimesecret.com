We've expanded our data center options with a new Canadian location. The Canada region ([ca.onetimesecret.com](https://ca.onetimesecret.com)) follows our share-nothing architecture - ensuring data created in Canada stays in Canada.


## Now Serving Canadian Customers


We're pleased to introduce our new Canada locality, further enhancing our data privacy options and expanding user choice. The Canada instance is now available at ca.onetimesecret.com, complementing our existing EU site at eu.onetimesecret.com and our US site at us.onetimesecret.com.

### A Share-Nothing Architecture

At the core of this expansion is our dedication to a share-nothing architecture. This means that each data center operates independently, ensuring complete data isolation between regions. Here's what this means for users:

- Data created in the Canada region stays in Canada
- Each region maintains its own separate database, mail server, and storage
- No cross-region data sharing or synchronization

### Why Canada?

Adding a Canadian region responds to the needs of organizations with specific data residency requirements in North America. Canadian privacy laws, while similar to EU regulations in many aspects, provide a distinct regulatory framework that many organizations must comply with.

### How to Use

Using the Canada instance is simple. Just visit ca.onetimesecret.com directly or select "Canada" from the region selector on the main site. All the security features and functionality you expect from Onetime Secret are available in the Canada region.

For organizations requiring dedicated instances or custom deployments within specific regions, [please contact us](https://onetimesecret.com/feedback) to discuss your requirements.


## Looking Forward

The addition of our Canada region represents our ongoing commitment to data privacy and security. We continue to evaluate additional regions based on user needs and regulatory requirements.

**User:**

Do you feel inspired enough [by this blog post] to generate a comparable blog post image SVG like we did for the US post?


---

**Assistant:**

I'll create an SVG image for the Canada region announcement, similar to the style seen in the US post.

This SVG image for the Canada region announcement features:

1. Dark blue background consistent with the Onetime Secret brand
2. "Canada Region Now Available" title
3. A stylized maple leaf representing Canada
4. All three domain listings (EU, US, and CA) with the CA domain highlighted
5. Visual elements representing the separate data centers
6. A "share-nothing architecture" representation showing isolated data stores
7. Brand-appropriate pink and red accent colors

The image complements the blog post while maintaining the same professional style used in the US region announcement.

**User:**

Interesting. Do you know why there's a box over the canada domain?

---

**Assistant:**

I added a highlight box around the CA domain to emphasize it as the new addition. The box is intended to draw attention to the new Canada domain while keeping the other domains visible but less emphasized. This visual hierarchy helps readers immediately spot what's new in the lineup of regional options.

**User:**

Dont forget to add a byline at the bottom on the right, like we did in the US image

---


**Assistant:**

I'll update the SVG to include a proper byline at the bottom right.

I've added the byline "Crafted by Claude 3.5 Sonnet with minimal supervision" at the bottom right of the image, matching the style used in the US region announcement. This maintains consistency across your blog posts while adding the professional touch that acknowledges the creation process.
