## Announcement: Canada Region Now Available

We're pleased to introduce our new Canada locality, further enhancing our data privacy options and expanding user choice. The Canada instance is now available at ca.onetimesecret.com, complementing our existing EU site at eu.onetimesecret.com and our US site at us.onetimesecret.com.

### A Share-Nothing Architecture

At the core of this expansion is our dedication to a share-nothing architecture. This means that each data center operates independently, ensuring complete data isolation between regions. Here's what this means for users:

- Data created in the Canada region stays in Canada
- Each region maintains its own separate database
- No cross-region data sharing or synchronization
- Enhanced compliance with regional data sovereignty requirements

### Why Canada?

Adding a Canadian region responds to the needs of organizations with specific data residency requirements in North America. Canadian privacy laws, while similar to EU regulations in many aspects, provide a distinct regulatory framework that many organizations must comply with.

The Canada region offers:
- Data storage exclusively within Canadian borders
- Compliance with local privacy regulations
- Reduced latency for users in Canada and northern US regions
- Additional geographical redundancy option

### How to Use

Using the Canada instance is simple. Just visit ca.onetimesecret.com directly or select "Canada" from the region selector on the main site. All the security features and functionality you expect from Onetime Secret are available in the Canada region.

For organizations requiring dedicated instances or custom deployments within specific regions, [please contact us](https://onetimesecret.com/feedback) to discuss your requirements.


## Looking Forward

The addition of our Canada region represents our ongoing commitment to data privacy and security. We continue to evaluate additional regions based on user needs and regulatory requirements.
