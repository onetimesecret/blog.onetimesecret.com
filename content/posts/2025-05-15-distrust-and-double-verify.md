**Key sections to include:**
1. Visual markers of authentic sites (UI elements unique to our service)
2. Technical verification steps (SSL certificate details, domain patterns)
3. Red flags that indicate an impostor site
4. What to do if you encounter a suspicious site
5. How to report potential impostors

This separation allows your current post to focus on the engineering and strategic aspects of your domain architecture while still addressing the security concerns that prompted the changes.
