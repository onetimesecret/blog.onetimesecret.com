Following our [domain architecture update](/content/posts/2025-05-14-homepage-post-as-in-after), this guide provides concrete methods to verify authentic Onetime Secret services and identify impostor sites.


## Website Address Verification

The most reliable way to verify authentic Onetime Secret services:

- **Regional Subdomains**: All legitimate OnetimeSecret services use regional prefixes in their web addresses (e.g., `eu.onetimesecret.com`, `us.onetimesecret.com`, `nz.onetimesecret.com`). On genuine sites, all regional variations will function properly.

- **Simple Verification Test**: If you're on us.onetimesecret.com, try changing to eu.onetimesecret.com in your browser's address bar. It should load our service with European regional settings.

- **Main Website Address**: The core website address is always `onetimesecret.com` - no variations, hyphens, or character substitutions.

Avoid lookalikes such as _one-timesecret.com_, _1timesecret.org_, _onetimesecret-secure.com_, and any domains with subtle character substitutions like _onetímesecret.com_ (using the accented letter "í" instead of regular "i")

## Technical Verification

For technical users, verify these elements:

- **Domain Registration**: Official domains registered since 2011 (verify via [WHOIS](https://whois.gandi.net/en/results?search=onetimesecret.com))
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All legitimate services enforce HTTPS with HSTS (see [HSTS Preload List](https://hstspreload.org/?search=onetimesecret.com))
- **DNS Records**: Verify A record via [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/#A/onetimesecret.com). 
  - ✅ Should be all green check marks indicating valid records. 
  - ❌ Red X marks or missing records suggest a fraudulent site.
  
  
## Official Web Presence

To establish trust in the domain you're on, check the following popular sites to compare the spelling of "onetimesecret.com".

- **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret)
- **BlueSky**: [@onetimesecret.com](https://bsky.app/profile/onetimesecret.com)
- **Docker Hub**: [hub.docker.com/r/onetimesecret/onetimesecret](https://hub.docker.com/r/onetimesecret/onetimesecret)
- **Internet Archive**: [View our 10+ year history](https://web.archive.org/web/*/onetimesecret.com)
- **Hacker News Discussion (2011)**: [Original announcement and discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3207489)


## Visual Clues (Secondary Verification)

While visual elements can be easily mimicked, these secondary checks may help supplement domain verification:

- **Functional Navigation**: All links to documentation, blog, and status pages should be operational and lead to legitimate domains within the onetimesecret.com ecosystem.
- **Attention to Detail**: Check for inconsistencies in UI elements, typography errors, or broken functionality that might indicate a hastily-created impostor.

**Note**: Visual verification alone is insufficient. Always verify the domain pattern first.
