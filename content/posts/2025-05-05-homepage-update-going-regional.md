OnetimeSecret.com has been around for quite a while – long enough to attract several impostor sites ranging from confusingly similar to downright malicious. Thanks to our alert users and partners (like in this [recent GitHub issue](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret/issues/1233)), we can spot and address these problems.

## The Challenge

We're facing three main issues:
1. **Brand confusion**: With multiple legitimate domains, users struggle to identify which one to actually use
2. **Account fragmentation**: Users accidentally create accounts across different regional versions
3. **Security threats**: Malicious impostor sites appear in search results to capture sensitive data

## Our Solution: Regional Domains

Over the past year, we've launched several regional domains (eu.onetimesecret.com, us.onetimesecret.com, etc.) to address privacy concerns and support data sovereignty – your data stays in your chosen region. This expansion also helps scale our infrastructure for our growing user base.

There's no perfect defense against determined impostors. Rather than seeking a single silver mullet, our regional domain strategy adds an important security layer while improving user experience.

Our approach balances security with familiarity:

1. **Functionality Preserved:** The main site will still create secrets while prominently featuring regional options.
2. **Clear Guidance:** We're adding straightforward information about why regional domains matter for your security.

## What This Means For You

**Good news:** All your secret links will continue to work exactly as before. We've been quietly preparing for this change for months.

When you click any secret link, you'll automatically go to the right regional domain — no extra steps needed.

### Your Regional Options

Pick the region closest to you for best performance

- **European Union**: [eu.onetimesecret.com](https:///eu.onetimesecret.com/)
- **Canada**: [ca.onetimesecret.com](https://ca.onetimesecret.com/)
- **United States**: [us.onetimesecret.com](https://us.onetimesecret.com/)
- **Aotearoa New Zealand**: [nz.onetimesecret.com](https://nz.onetimesecret.com/)
- **United Kingdom**: uk.onetimesecret.com (coming soon)

If you're outside these regions, select the closest geographical option for optimal speed.

### Quick Tip: Update Your Bookmarks

Consider bookmarking your preferred regional domain for:
- Faster loading times
- Better security (you'll always know where your data is)
- No redirects from the main site

Remember, only the main site is changing. Your regional experience stays the same.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my existing secrets still work?
Yep. All existing secret links will continue to function without interruption. Actually, all new secret links will continue to work as they do now as well.

### Do I need to create a new account?
No. If you don't already have an account, you're most welcome to create one on your region of choice. But there's no need to in relation to these changes.

### What happens if I accidentally use the main domain?
The main domain will still function, offering basic secret creation with clear guidance to regional options.

### How does this improve security?
Regional domains establish a consistent pattern that makes it easier to identify authentic Onetime Secret services. This helps users distinguish our legitimate services from potential impostors with a similar-looking domain.

## Next Steps

These changes will go live on May 12th (2025). We're looking forward to providing a more helpful and more secure experience. As always, [we welcome your feedback](https://eu.onetimesecret.com/feedback) on these improvements as we continue to enhance both security and usability.
