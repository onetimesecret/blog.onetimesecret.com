Just in case you wanted to see it more closely, it's lots of this:

```plaintext

```

Different headers, different IP addresses, but all the same or similar pattern.

### Cascade of failures

I'm not sure yet exactly when the attack stopped. It got to a point around lunch time where we'd tried to bring the site back up in a few different ways and started to get wires crossed. For example, caddy was really struggling so we put haproxy in front, but we needed to copy the TLS certificates from the caddy config in order to do that. Then we went to DNS verification with acme.sh and that worked great (getting the certs) but had issues getting haproxy and caddy to work together.

In some ways, we can be thankful because it revealed failure-points in our infrastructure. We'll be able to fix these issues and improve our resilience. It's still a major disruption to our service so I don't feel great about it.

## Post-mortem to follow

We're still investigating the nature of the attack and will put a post mortem together soon.
