Can refer to previous posts re: homepage update, domain clarity. 


## Our Domain Structure

* **`onetimesecret.com`**: Marketing site and portal to regional applications
* **Regional domains** (`eu.onetimesecret.com`, `us.onetimesecret.com`, etc): Main application instances with share-nothing architecture, providing data sovereignty and operational scalability
* **Supporting domains**:
  * **`docs.onetimesecret.com`**: Comprehensive documentation
  * **`blog.onetimesecret.com`**: Product updates and engineering insights
  * **`status.onetimesecret.com`**: Service status and incident reporting
* **`*.onetimesecret.dev`**: Exclusively for non-production environments, clearly separated from production


## Our `.dev`: A True Non-Production Mirror

Our `.dev` TLD serves exclusively for non-production environments, providing clear separation from production systems:

* **Clear Prod/Non-Prod Distinction:** `.onetimesecret.dev` creates an unmistakable boundary between our production environment (`*.onetimesecret.com`) and all non-production activities.

* **Apex Domain Mirroring:** We mirror our production domain structure (e.g., `us.onetimesecret.dev` corresponding to `us.onetimesecret.com`). This allows development environments to replicate production DNS configurations with high fidelity, reducing "works on my machine" issues.

* **Technical Advantages:** This approach provides strict origin separation (HSTS preload), clean cookie jars, and clear visual distinction for developers and testers.

This avoids subtle problems that arise when non-production environments are subdomains of the production TLD, ensuring cleaner separation of concerns.
