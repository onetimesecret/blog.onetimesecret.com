# Our Documentation Domain Strategy: Why We Chose Clarity Over Convention

![Documentation Domain Strategy](/img/blog/2025/documentation-domain-strategy.svg)

As we continue to grow, we've made a strategic decision about our domain structure that prioritizes clarity and technical consistency. This post explains our approach to documentation domains and the technical reasoning behind it.

## The Question of .dev

Many tech companies face the question: should technical documentation live at docs.example.com or docs.example.dev? After careful consideration, we've chosen to keep everything under our primary domain structure.

While .dev domains offer certain advantages (enforced HTTPS, clear visual differentiation), we found that most respected tech companies maintain their documentation ecosystem within their primary domain structure:

- Stripe uses docs.stripe.com for comprehensive documentation
- Twilio centralizes at twilio.com/docs
- GitHub keeps developer resources at docs.github.com

## Our Technical Reasoning

Our decision wasn't just about following industry practices. We considered several technical factors:

1. **Origin Consistency**: Keeping documentation under the same TLD eliminates cross-origin complexities for our interactive examples.

2. **Simplified DNS Management**: Managing a single domain structure reduces operational overhead and potential points of failure.

3. **Clear Mental Model**: Users intuitively understand that docs.onetimesecret.com is our authoritative documentation source.

4. **Seamless Authentication**: Our documentation includes interactive elements that benefit from sharing the same authentication context as our main application.

## Where We Do Use .dev

Interestingly, we do leverage .dev domains, but for a different purpose: development environments. The .dev TLD offers significant advantages for non-production environments:

- Complete DNS configuration parity with production
- Strict origin separation from our production domains
- Automatic HTTPS enforcement through preloaded HSTS
- Clean cookie isolation between environments

This approach gives our developers identical DNS behavior between environments while maintaining strong security boundaries.

## Future Documentation Structure

Our documentation will continue to evolve with our clear domain strategy:

- **docs.onetimesecret.com**: Comprehensive documentation for all users
- **blog.onetimesecret.com**: Product and engineering insights (you're here now!)
- **api.onetimesecret.com**: Developer-focused API reference

This structure balances simplicity with the specific needs of different audience segments, all while maintaining the technical benefits of our primary domain.

## What's your approach?

We're curious how others have structured their documentation domains. Have you chosen .dev for technical documentation, or kept everything under your primary domain? Share your experiences with us on GitHub.

Thought process7sLet me review the conversation and identify specific details and insights that weren't included in the latest draft:

The initial question was about whether it's a convention for .dev domains to use docs.example.com for product documentation and docs.example.dev for SDK/API/technical documentation.
I researched how major tech companies structure their documentation domains, including:

Stripe's domain structure (docs.stripe.com, api.stripe.com, stripe.dev)
Twilio's approach (www.twilio.com/docs)
GitHub's approach (docs.github.com, developer.github.com)
Google, Amazon, Microsoft patterns


The technical insight about using .dev for non-production environments because it offers DNS configuration parity, which was in the human's comment: "Using .dev as non-prod has the advantage of being 'identical' in terms of the nuances in DNS and related technologies between a subdomain, the apex domain, www. etc"
The specific technical advantages I expanded on for using .dev domains:

DNS configuration parity
Complete origin separation
Cookie isolation
Forced HTTPS (HSTS preload list)
Clear visual distinction


The fact that the conversation revealed that Google, despite controlling the .dev TLD, redirects google.dev to developers.google.com, showing they don't even follow the potential convention themselves.
The section heading "Separation of Resources and Environments" was created but doesn't fully reflect the nuanced technical insight about DNS parity that prompted it.
The human asked for "separation of merch and..." which suggests they wanted a more specific or catchy section heading than what was provided.
The request for an SVG image was fulfilled with a simple diagram showing the domain structure strategy, but it's not clear if it fully captures the specific insights discussed.
The finding that major companies don't follow a strict convention of using .dev for technical documentation but instead organize by function under their primary domain.


Key elements missing from the latest draft:

1. The specific observation that Google (who controls the .dev TLD) redirects google.dev to developers.google.com, highlighting how even the TLD controller doesn't follow the supposed convention.

2. The "Separation of Resources and Environments" heading doesn't fully capture the technical nuance about DNS parity - it could be more specific about the environment separation benefits.

3. The requested headline "Separation of Merch and..." was not completed or incorporated.

4. The draft doesn't explain how most companies organize by function rather than audience type (product vs technical documentation).

5. Missing explanation of how companies typically organize using information architecture within a single domain rather than splitting across TLDs.

6. No mention of how apex domains vs. www subdomains behave differently and how .dev addresses this.

7. The reference to cross-origin complexities doesn't explain the specific technical issues this could cause for interactive examples.

8. No discussion of potential SEO implications of using multiple TLDs vs. consolidated domains.

9. The SVG image is generic and doesn't specifically illustrate the DNS configuration parity concept that was central to the discussion.

Additional elements worth considering for the post:

1. Complete the "Separation of Merch and..." to "Separation of Merch and Method" - distinguishing between customer-facing marketing sites and development environments

2. Include concrete examples of cross-origin issues that would affect interactive documentation (CORS restrictions, localStorage/sessionStorage isolation, etc.)

3. Mention canonical URL considerations and how search engines treat content across different TLDs

4. Discuss performance benefits when documentation shares resources with the main application (cached assets, shared components)

5. Address future-proofing aspects - how having documentation under the primary domain simplifies rebranding or infrastructure changes

6. Connect this strategy to Onetime Secret's existing "share-nothing architecture" for regional deployments (mentioned in your blog posts about regional data centers)

7. Include monitoring and observability benefits - unified analytics and error tracking across all properties

8. Address security considerations for documentation that contains interactive elements that might need to access production APIs
