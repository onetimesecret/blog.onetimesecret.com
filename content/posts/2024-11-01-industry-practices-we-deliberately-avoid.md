# Our Privacy-First Approach
At Onetime Secret, we believe privacy and simplicity go hand in hand. While many services collect extensive user data, we've chosen a different path focused on what matters most: secure, reliable secret sharing. You can learn more about our guiding principles in our [documentation](https://docs.onetimesecret.com/principles).


## Focused Communication
You'll only receive emails you specifically request: secret link deliveries and account-critical notifications. No newsletters, no promotions - just the service you need, when you need it. Any new email types will be opt-in only.


## Clean, Secure Experience
We maintain a straightforward service by excluding:
- Third-party analytics
- Social media integrations
- External advertising
- Tracking frameworks

This isn't just about privacy - it's about providing a faster, more reliable service focused solely on secure secret sharing.

## Why This Matters
Every feature we exclude is a conscious choice to:
- Enhance security
- Improve reliability
- Protect privacy
- Maintain simplicity

## Our Commitment
We focus our resources on:
- Core functionality improvements
- Security enhancements
- Service reliability
- Compliance and transparency

## Looking Forward
We believe that the best privacy tool is one that simply works when you need it, without unnecessary features or constant engagement. While this approach may mean slower growth compared to services that prioritize marketing, we're committed to maintaining this standard.

delano: Create a beauty of an creative SVG illustration to represent this blog post

GitHub Copilot: Creating a beautiful and creative SVG illustration involves a few steps. Here's a plan:

1. **Conceptualize the Illustration**: Since the blog post is about privacy, simplicity, and secure secret sharing, the illustration should reflect these themes.
2. **Design Elements**: Use elements like a lock, shield, envelope, and minimalistic design to convey security and simplicity.
3. **Create the SVG**: Write the SVG code to create the illustration.

Here's an SVG illustration that represents the blog post:

```xml
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Background -->
  <rect width="200" height="200" fill="#f0f0f0" />

  <!-- Shield -->
  <path d="M100 20 L130 50 L130 120 L100 150 L70 120 L70 50 Z" fill="#4CAF50" stroke="#388E3C" stroke-width="5" />

  <!-- Lock -->
  <rect x="85" y="70" width="30" height="40" fill="#FFC107" stroke="#FFA000" stroke-width="3" />
  <rect x="95" y="50" width="10" height="20" fill="#FFC107" stroke="#FFA000" stroke-width="3" />
  <circle cx="100" cy="90" r="5" fill="#FFA000" />

  <!-- Envelope -->
  <rect x="50" y="130" width="100" height="60" fill="#2196F3" stroke="#1976D2" stroke-width="3" />
  <polyline points="50,130 100,170 150,130" fill="none" stroke="#1976D2" stroke-width="3" />

  <!-- Text -->
  <text x="100" y="190" font-family="Arial" font-size="14" fill="#333" text-anchor="middle">
    Secure &amp; Simple
  </text>
</svg>
```

You can copy and paste this SVG code into an HTML file to see the illustration. This SVG includes a shield to represent security, a lock to symbolize privacy, and an envelope to indicate secure communication. The minimalistic design aligns with the theme of simplicity.
