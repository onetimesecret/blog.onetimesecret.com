# Our Privacy-First Approach
At Onetime Secret, we believe privacy and simplicity go hand in hand. While many services collect extensive user data, we've chosen a different path focused on what matters most: secure, reliable secret sharing.

## Focused Communication
You'll only receive emails you specifically request: secret link deliveries and account-critical notifications. No newsletters, no promotions - just the service you need, when you need it.

## Clean, Secure Experience
We maintain a straightforward service by excluding:
- Third-party analytics
- Social media integrations
- External advertising
- Tracking frameworks

This isn't just about privacy - it's about providing a faster, more reliable service focused solely on secure secret sharing.

## Why This Matters
Every feature we exclude is a conscious choice to:
- Enhance security
- Improve reliability
- Protect privacy
- Maintain simplicity

## Our Commitment
We focus our resources on:
- Core functionality improvements
- Security enhancements
- Service reliability
- Compliance and transparency

## Looking Forward
We believe that the best privacy tool is one that simply works when you need it, without unnecessary features or constant engagement. While this approach may mean slower growth compared to services that prioritize marketing, we're committed to maintaining this standard.
