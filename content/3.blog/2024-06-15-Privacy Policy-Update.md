_When we first launched in 2012, we never anticipated the widespread use and trust that our platform has gained over the years. To put it simply, we've been really fortunate to have a product that people have stuck with for more than a decade._

_As our user base has grown and evolved, so have their expectations and needs, which has prompted these much-needed updates. We're incredibly grateful for the trust you've placed in us over the years and are committed to continuing to earn that trust through open, transparent communication and secure data handling practices._

## Summary
Here is a summary of the changes:

### Updated Language to Ensure Clarity and Consistency
The original text had some inconsistencies in language, such as using "you" or "your" in certain contexts. The updated text provides a more consistent tone by using "we," "our," and "us" throughout to clearly indicate that the policy is being provided by the service or company.

### Emphasized Data Protection Measures
The new version highlights specific security measures implemented by the service, such as secure encryption mechanisms (SSL) and regular security audits and updates on servers. This adds a layer of assurance to users regarding their data's safety.

### Added Clarification for Sensitive Personal Information
In the original text, there was a mention of not intentionally collecting sensitive personal information, but it lacked detail. The update now explicitly states that social security numbers, genetic data, health information, and religious information are examples of sensitive data that should not be stored or collected intentionally.

### Addressed Content Ownership and Responsibility
The new version provides clearer guidelines on content ownership. It states that users are responsible for the content they input and ensure its compliance with the service's Terms of Service. This emphasizes the importance of users maintaining the accuracy and appropriateness of their information.

### Updated Child User Policy
Both versions had a similar statement regarding children under the age of 13, but the new version provides slightly more detail. It mentions that the service does not knowingly collect information from or direct content specifically to children under 13 and that having an account on the service requires users to be above this age.

### Changed the Language for Data Storage and Transmission
In the original text, there was a mention of how "No method of transmission is 100% secure..." however, the new version replaces it with a more detailed explanation, stating that absolute security cannot be guaranteed due to the inherent risks in any electronic data storage or transmission method. This provides a more comprehensive understanding of the potential limitations in data protection.

### Added Information about Pixel Tags in Emails
The new version includes a mention of pixel tags, which are small clear images used in emails to track user engagement. This is a common practice and provides transparency to users about how their interactions with the service may be monitored.

### Updated the Language for Privacy Policy Updates
The original text only mentioned providing notice through the website for changes. However, the new version also mentions sending email to the email address specified in the primary account, ensuring that users receive timely notifications about any changes to the privacy policy.

### Formatting Changes
The new version has slightly improved formatting and sentence structure, making the content more readable and ensuring that the information is presented in a clear and concise manner.

### License Information
The new version includes the specific Creative Commons Zero license link for the document itself and provides a direct link to the site-policy repository for reference (reproduced at the end of this commit message). This adds clarity and allows interested parties to easily access the license details and history of the document.

These changes primarily focus on enhancing the clarity, consistency, and transparency of the privacy policy, addressing potential loopholes, and providing a better understanding of the service's data handling practices.
