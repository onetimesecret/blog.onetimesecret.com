I worked on a new UI over the weekend and pushed it live today. Thanks to [Twitter's Bootstrap v2](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework it's cleaner, easier to use, and works great on small (mobile) screens too. Here are a couple comparisons (old vs new):

## Homepage

Our new homepage design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, making it easier for users to understand and access our core service: secure, one-time sharing of sensitive information.

## Created Secret

We've streamlined the process of creating a secret, ensuring that users can quickly and securely share sensitive information. Remember, each secret link only works once and then disappears forever.

## Shared Secret

The shared secret view now provides a clearer interface for recipients, enhancing our primary use case of sharing passwords and sensitive messages that are automatically destroyed after viewing.

## Conclusion
These UI improvements are part of our ongoing commitment to providing a secure, user-friendly platform for sharing sensitive information. The new design not only enhances the visual appeal but also improves functionality, especially on mobile devices. This update reinforces our core mission: offering a simple, reliable way to share passwords and confidential messages that self-destruct after a single view.

We're confident that these changes will make your experience with Onetime Secret even more seamless and secure. However, your feedback is crucial to our continuous improvement. If you have any thoughts on the new UI, encounter any issues, or have suggestions for future enhancements, please [let us know](https://onetimesecret.com/feedback). Your input helps us ensure that Onetime Secret remains the go-to solution for one-time, secure information sharing.

Remember, at Onetime Secret, your security is our priority. Each secret link works only once before disappearing forever, providing you with peace of mind when sharing sensitive data.

Thank you for your continued trust in Onetime Secret. We're excited to keep evolving our service to meet your secure sharing needs.
